# docker-hpc-cluster
HPC cluster deployment solution for different environments, requirements and devices
The main goal of this project is to provide a single docker solution that spans accross multiple use cases, depending on: 
hardware requirements or availability,
environment needs.

The different flavours/versions offer an HPC environment that is meant to be used for testing (as a sandbox), developing or 
for research porpuses. Its use on a prodution environment is not supported by the authors of this project or the authors of the
projects the images were based upon.
