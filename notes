ideas 26/02/19:

Now that we've found one way to set the shared filesystem on the nodes 
(see my dockerhub starred repos).
We must take into consideration some other factors like speed, the architecture the found image uses,
how hard or how well is it going to be to integrate the image into the project, so the nodes can mount it.
For example, there are other plugins and connectors that enable storage accross the containers within
a swarm cluster.

One main advantage of using the nfs share image found at dockerhub is that is can be deployed
as a service, which follows the microservice architecture docker promotes and supports.

also, we must define a standarized way to launch the clusters.
The best way i can think of is to define a compose file that launches the alpine cluster.
but that is going to bring some challenges:
- how to parametrize the names, ports, repos that are used to create/launch the image? 
- how is the solution going to scale up or down properly by using docker stacks?

next steps,

now that we now that the shared filesystem problem is already solved, 
we must standarize the way the projects are launched. After that, the previously mentioned
filesystem share will be done.
